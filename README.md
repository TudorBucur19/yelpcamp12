This is a fullstack project, built within "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course from udemy.com, and also my first web aplication, in which I became familiar with basic web languages.
Technologies I used: 
 - Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
 - Backend - NodeJs, Express, MongoDb.
 
 The project is deployed here:  https://whispering-wave-09574.herokuapp.com
